# Driver Update Feature - Complete Guide

## Overview

The Driver Update feature provides robust, multi-layered driver detection and installation for Windows systems. It intelligently handles various Windows configurations, including restricted environments where Windows Update service may be disabled.

## How It Works

### Detection Methods (in order of priority)

1. **PSWindowsUpdate Module** (Primary Method)
   - Most reliable and feature-rich
   - Automatically installed on first use
   - Works with Windows Update service in various states
   - Provides detailed driver information including size and KB numbers

2. **Windows Update COM API** (Fallback)
   - Native Windows Update integration
   - Uses Microsoft.Update.Session COM object
   - Requires Windows Update service to be running
   - Provides manufacturer, class, and version information

3. **WMI Device Detection** (Last Resort)
   - Uses Win32_PnpEntity WMI class
   - Detects devices with driver problems (ConfigManagerErrorCode > 0)
   - Shows which devices need attention even if updates can't be downloaded
   - Helps users identify what needs manual intervention

### Automatic Service Management

The app intelligently handles Windows Update service states:

- **Running**: Proceeds with driver check
- **Stopped**: Automatically attempts to start the service (requires admin rights)
- **Disabled**: Informs user with instructions to enable it manually
- **Error**: Provides context-specific troubleshooting steps

## Prerequisites

### Required
- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- Internet connection (for downloading drivers)
- Administrator privileges (for installing drivers and starting services)

### Optional but Recommended
- Windows Update service enabled (at least set to "Manual")
- PowerShell 5.0 or higher (included in Windows 10/11)

## Usage Instructions

### Basic Workflow

1. **Launch the Application**
   - For full functionality, right-click and select "Run as Administrator"

2. **Navigate to Driver Updates**
   - Click "Driver Updates" from the home page

3. **Initial Service Check**
   - The app automatically checks Windows Update service status
   - If stopped, it attempts to start it
   - If disabled, follow on-screen instructions

4. **Check for Driver Updates**
   - Click "Check for Driver Updates"
   - First-time use: PSWindowsUpdate module may be installed (1-2 minutes)
   - Wait for the scan to complete (typically 30-60 seconds)

5. **Review Available Updates**
   - Driver list shows available updates with details
   - Information includes: title, manufacturer, class, size, KB number

6. **Select Drivers to Update**
   - Use checkboxes to select individual drivers
   - "Select All" / "Deselect All" for batch operations
   - Review the count: "X of Y selected"

7. **Install Selected Drivers**
   - Click "Update Selected Drivers (X)"
   - Confirm the operation
   - System restore point is created automatically
   - Wait for installation (can take 10-30 minutes for large drivers)
   - Reboot if prompted

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Windows Update service not available"

#### If Service is Stopped
**Solution 1: Run as Administrator**
```
1. Close the application
2. Right-click the app icon
3. Select "Run as Administrator"
4. Try checking for drivers again
```

The app will automatically start the service when running with admin privileges.

#### If Service is Disabled
**Solution 2: Enable the Service Manually**
```
1. Press Win + R
2. Type: services.msc
3. Press Enter
4. Scroll to "Windows Update"
5. Right-click > Properties
6. Set "Startup type" to "Manual" (recommended) or "Automatic"
7. Click "Start" button
8. Click "OK"
9. Restart the application
```

**Why "Manual" is Recommended:**
- Service starts only when needed
- Conserves system resources
- Suitable for most users
- Can still be used by the app

**Corporate/Enterprise Systems:**
If your organization uses WSUS or has disabled Windows Update via Group Policy:
- The service may be forcibly disabled
- Contact your IT department
- Use the WMI detection method to identify problem devices
- Request manual driver updates from IT

### PSWindowsUpdate Module Issues

#### Installation Takes Too Long
- Normal first-time installation: 1-2 minutes
- Requires active internet connection
- If it exceeds 5 minutes, cancel and retry
- App will fall back to COM API if installation fails

#### Module Installation Fails
**Common Causes:**
- No internet connection
- PowerShell execution policy restrictions
- Insufficient permissions
- PSGallery repository unavailable

**Solutions:**
```powershell
# Check PowerShell version (must be 5.0+)
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion

# Check execution policy
Get-ExecutionPolicy

# If restricted, run as admin:
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Manually install PSWindowsUpdate
Install-Module -Name PSWindowsUpdate -Force -Scope CurrentUser
```

### No Driver Updates Found

**Possible Reasons:**
1. All drivers are already up to date (good!)
2. Windows Update doesn't have newer drivers
3. Manufacturer-specific drivers not in Windows Update catalog

**What to Do:**
- Visit your PC manufacturer's website for brand-specific driver packages
- For individual components (GPU, etc.), check manufacturer websites:
  - NVIDIA: nvidia.com/Download
  - AMD: amd.com/support
  - Intel: intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center

### Driver Installation Fails

#### During Download
- Check internet connection
- Verify sufficient disk space (drivers can be 500MB-2GB)
- Temporarily disable antivirus/firewall
- Retry with individual drivers instead of batch

#### During Installation
- Ensure no other driver updates are in progress
- Close other applications that might be using the device
- Check if the device is removable (USB devices may need to be reconnected)
- Restore from system restore point if system becomes unstable

### Permission Errors

**Error: "Administrator privileges required"**

**Solution:**
```
1. Close the application
2. Right-click the application icon
3. Select "Run as Administrator"
4. Windows will prompt for UAC confirmation
5. Click "Yes"
```

**Making Administrator Mode Default:**
```
1. Right-click the application shortcut
2. Select "Properties"
3. Go to "Compatibility" tab
4. Check "Run this program as an administrator"
5. Click "OK"
```

### Corporate Environment Issues

**Group Policy Restrictions:**
Many organizations disable or restrict Windows Update. Symptoms:
- Service shows as "Disabled" and cannot be changed
- Starting the service fails even with admin rights
- Updates are managed by WSUS/SCCM

**What You Can Do:**
1. Use the WMI detection mode:
   - Identifies devices with driver problems
   - Provides device names and error descriptions
   - Use this list to request updates from IT

2. Contact IT Department:
   - Provide the list of devices needing updates
   - Request driver update deployment
   - Ask about driver update policy

3. Check for Manual Updates:
   - Open Device Manager (devmgmt.msc)
   - Look for yellow warning icons
   - Note device names
   - Submit ticket to IT helpdesk
